# Handwashing_R
Welcome to the Handwashing_R repository! This repository is dedicated to exploring the history and significance of handwashing, with a focus on the discovery of handwashing by Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis.

As you may know, handwashing wasn't always a common practice, especially before the discovery of the germ theory. As a result, doctors would perform autopsies and then go on to deliver babies without washing their hands, leading to the spread of disease such as childbed fever.

However, thanks to the pioneering work of Dr. Ignaz Semmelweis and others, the importance of handwashing in preventing infection and saving lives is now widely recognized.

This repository is based on a Data camp project and walks us through the journey of handwashing discovery, including the challenges and obstacles faced by Dr. Semmelweis, and the impact his work has had on healthcare today. It also includes a range of data analysis and visualization tools to help us understand the data and insights.

Whether you're a healthcare professional, a history buff, or simply someone who is interested in the science of infection prevention, this repository is a valuable resource. We hope you enjoy exploring the content and learning more about the history and importance of handwashing
